##  Repository Structure

| Folder / File | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Data Cleaning/** | Scripts and notebooks demonstrating real-world dataset cleaning – handling missing values, inconsistent formats, filtering noise, etc. |
| **Data_analysis with SQL and Python/** | Combination of SQL queries and Python-based analysis for practical business insights. |
| **NLP to SQL query/** | A Natural Language → SQL conversion approach using NLP techniques to generate database queries from user text. |
| **Netflix content strategy analysis/** | Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization of Netflix content trends to derive strategic insights. |
| **ThermaOracle/** | Predictive modeling and EDA related to thermal or meteorological data (environment-focused ML experiment). |
| **gradio.ipynb** | A simple interactive Gradio interface demonstrating ML model deployment and inference. |

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then open relevant Jupyter notebooks:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

##  About the Projects

Each project is independent. Feel free to explore them in any order:

### 🔹 Data Cleaning

Focuses on real dataset issues: duplicates, missing values, transformations.

### 🔹 SQL + Python Analysis

Combines relational querying with statistical insights in Python.

### 🔹 NLP → SQL Query

Prototype system transforming human questions into valid SQL.

### 🔹 Netflix Strategy Analysis

Content category patterns, regional productions, genre expansion, etc.

### 🔹 ThermaOracle

Data processing and modeling from temperature or industrial sensor datasets.
